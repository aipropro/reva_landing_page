Before you even start writing a single line of code or designing any pixels for your REVA landing page, extensive planning and preparation are crucial. This will ensure that your landing page is not just aesthetically pleasing but is also highly effective at converting visitors into paying founding members, ultimately helping you reach your $100k pre-sales goal.

Here's a detailed checklist of what you need to plan and prepare:

## I. Strategic Clarity & Content Planning

### 1. Refine Your Value Proposition & Messaging
-   **Core Problem:** Clearly articulate the *single biggest pain point* REVA solves for real estate agents globally, but with a nuanced understanding of MY/SG specifics. (e.g., "90% lead loss after 2 hours," "compliance burdens," "manual follow-ups") [PROJECT_OVERVIEW_AND_SCOPE]
-   **Unique Solution:** How does REVA uniquely solve this problem? Emphasize the "voice-first AI," "sub-500ms response," and "compliance-by-design" aspects.
-   **Key Benefits:** Translate features into benefits. (e.g., "save 40% time," "increase conversion by 35-60%," "24/7 lead capture") [PROJECT_OVERVIEW_AND_SCOPE]
-   **Differentiators:** Why REVA over competitors or existing solutions? (e.g., MY/SG localization, real-time voice, e-sign workflow).

### 2. Define Your Founders Program Offer (Finalize Tiers & Pricing)
-   **Solidify Pricing:** Confirm the exact pricing for each tier ($2,500 Elite, $1,500 Standard, $750 Explorer Access). Ensure these prices justify the value for early adopters and contribute to your $100k goal.
-   **Tier Benefits Matrix:** Create a clear, concise comparison table for each tier, outlining:
    *   Access level (e.g., 3-month access to beta)
    *   Features included (e.g., Live Voice, scheduling, e-sign)
    *   Exclusivity (e.g., direct founder calls, custom integrations)
    *   Support level (e.g., VIP, priority)
    *   Post-beta discount/incentives (e.g., lifetime discount, revenue sharing).
-   **Limited Spots:** Decide the exact number of spots for each tier to enforce scarcity (e.g., 20 Elite, 50 Standard, 30 Explorer).
-   **Application/Onboarding Process:** Outline the steps a founding member will take from applying to becoming an active member.

### 3. Gather & Prepare All Content Assets
-   **Headlines & Subheadlines:** Draft multiple compelling options for A/B testing.
-   **Body Copy:** Write concise, benefit-driven copy for each section of the landing page. Focus on clarity and persuasion.
-   **Call-to-Action (CTA) Copy:** Experiment with various CTA texts (e.g., "Secure My Founder Spot," "Apply for Exclusive Access," "Join the Future of Real Estate AI").
-   **Founding Team Bios:** Prepare short, impactful bios for key team members, highlighting relevant experience in real estate or AI.
-   **Testimonials/Endorsements (Early)**: If you have any industry advisors or early supporters, get their quotes and headshots. Even conceptual endorsements of the *idea* of REVA can build trust.
-   **Visuals (Narrative Videos)**:
    *   **Scripting:** Write detailed scripts for your narrative videos (e.g., "Day in the Life of an Agent," problem-solution mini-series).
    *   **Visual Elements List:** Identify specific stock footage, graphics, or animations needed for each scene.
    *   **Voiceover/Music:** Plan for professional voiceovers and appropriate background music.
    *   **Production Plan:** How will these videos be produced? (e.g., using free tools like Lumen5, InVideo, or engaging a freelancer).
-   **Images & Icons:** Curate high-quality stock photos (Unsplash) or design custom icons that align with your brand identity.
-   **Lead Magnet (Optional but Recommended):** Consider a valuable downloadable asset for early sign-ups (e.g., "The Ultimate Guide to AI in Real Estate," "Compliance Checklist for MY/SG Agents").

## II. Technical & Operational Preparation

### 1. Domain & Hosting
-   **Domain Name:** Purchase a memorable and relevant domain name for your landing page.
-   **Hosting:** Set up your hosting environment (Vercel for Next.js, Netlify for Astro, or your chosen no-code platform).

### 2. Analytics & Tracking Setup
-   **Google Analytics 4 (GA4):** Create a GA4 property and get your tracking ID. Plan what events you want to track (page views, button clicks, form submissions).
-   **Other Analytics:** Set up PostHog (for user behavior and A/B testing), Hotjar (heatmaps and session recordings), and relevant social media pixels (Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn Insight Tag) for future retargeting.
-   **Conversion Goals:** Define specific conversion goals in your analytics platforms (e.g., "Form Submitted," "Payment Initiated," "Payment Completed").

### 3. Lead Capture & CRM Integration
-   **Form Fields:** Determine all necessary form fields for your Founders Program application (name, email, phone, country, agency name, years in real estate, team size, biggest challenge).
-   **Email Marketing Platform:** Connect your landing page form to an email marketing service (MailerLite, Kit) to automatically add leads to your list and trigger welcome sequences.
-   **CRM/Spreadsheet:** Plan how you'll manage and track applicants. Initially, a shared Google Sheet might suffice, but consider a basic CRM if volume is high.

### 4. Payment Gateway Integration
-   **Stripe Account:** Set up a Stripe account (or equivalent) to process payments.
-   **Product Configuration:** Configure your different Founders Program tiers as "products" in your payment gateway with their respective prices.
-   **Payment Flow:** Design the user journey from selecting a tier to successful payment.
-   **Post-Payment Actions:** What happens after payment? (e.g., automatic welcome email, access to a private Slack/WhatsApp group, next steps for onboarding).

### 5. Legal & Compliance
-   **Privacy Policy:** Draft a clear and comprehensive privacy policy that complies with PDPA (Malaysia/Singapore), GDPR, and other relevant data protection regulations.
-   **Terms & Conditions:** Prepare terms and conditions for the Founders Program, outlining access, duration, refund policy, and product limitations (as it's still in beta).
-   **Cookie Consent Banner:** Implement a cookie consent solution if required by your target markets' regulations.

## III. Pre-Launch Marketing & Outreach Planning

### 1. Founders Program Outreach Strategy
-   **Initial Prospect List:** Compile a list of target real estate agents, agencies, and industry leaders in MY/SG and other regions.
-   **Personalized Outreach Scripts:** Draft personalized email and LinkedIn messages for direct outreach.
-   **Referral Incentives:** Clearly define and communicate the referral program for early applicants.

### 2. Social Media & Community Strategy
-   **Social Media Accounts:** Ensure your LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube profiles are set up and optimized.
-   **Content Calendar:** Plan out your initial social media posts to build anticipation, including teasers for the narrative videos.
-   **Community Engagement Plan:** Identify relevant real estate groups/forums where you can share your landing page and engage with potential founding members.

### 3. Post-Launch Follow-Up
-   **Email Welcome Sequence:** Plan a series of automated emails for people who sign up (thank you, program details, next steps).
-   **Nurture Sequences:** Develop content for those who express interest but don't immediately apply (e.g., case studies, more video content, FAQs).
-   **Rejection/Waitlist Plan:** What's the plan for applicants who don't qualify or when spots are full? (e.g., offer a waitlist, provide alternative resources).

By methodically addressing these planning and preparation steps, you'll lay a solid foundation for a successful landing page launch, maximizing your chances of hitting your $100k pre-sales target and gathering valuable insights for REVA's future development.
