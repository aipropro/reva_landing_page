Implementing a robust currency conversion mechanism on REVA's landing page, seamlessly integrated with Stripe for payment processing, is critical for attracting your global target audience and maximizing pre-sales. This involves both frontend display logic and backend payment setup.

### Detailed Footprint: Price Conversion & Stripe Integration

#### 1. Landing Page Automatic Price Conversion

This phase focuses on ensuring the pricing is displayed in the visitor's local currency as soon as they land on the page, enhancing user experience and trustworthiness.

*   **1.1. Visitor Location Detection**
    *   **Description**: Automatically determine the visitor's country.
    *   **Implementation**: Utilize an IP geolocation service (e.g., GeoIP2, IP2Location, or a built-in feature of your hosting like Vercel's GeoIP headers) on either the frontend (JavaScript) or backend (server-side middleware) when the page loads. The detected country code should be stored in a cookie or local storage to maintain consistency during their session.

*   **1.2. Currency Selection Logic**
    *   **Description**: Map the detected country to your predefined pricing currency for that market.
    *   **Implementation**: Maintain a mapping table (e.g., within your application's configuration) that links countries to their respective currencies and your specific tiered pricing. If a country is not explicitly supported with localized pricing, default to a base currency like USD or SGD. Optionally, provide a manual currency switcher for users to override the detected currency, with their selection persisted for their session.

*   **1.3. Real-Time Price Conversion**
    *   **Description**: Convert your base prices (e.g., SGD for Singapore, USD for US/Canada) into the local display currency using accurate exchange rates.
    *   **Implementation**: Integrate with a reliable backend currency exchange rate API (e.g., Fixer.io, CurrencyLayer, Open Exchange Rates). To ensure freshness without excessive API calls, schedule regular synchronization of these rates (e.g., hourly or every few hours) and cache them on your server. When a page loads, retrieve the relevant cached rate and dynamically calculate and display the converted price for each of your Founders Program tiers (Elite and Standard) with the correct currency symbols.

*   **1.4. Consistency and Transparency**
    *   **Description**: Ensure the displayed prices are consistent throughout the user's journey and that any conversion nuances are clear.
    *   **Implementation**: Always display the currency code or symbol (e.g., "$2,500 USD", "R$ 1,299 BRL"). Consider adding a small tooltip or informational text near the prices explaining that "Prices are based on current exchange rates and final charges may vary slightly depending on your bank's conversion and any fees applied by Stripe." This manages expectations and avoids surprises at checkout.

#### 2. Stripe Integration for Multi-Currency Handling

This phase ensures that Stripe correctly processes payments in the presented local currency and handles the necessary financial operations.

*   **2.1. Multi-Currency Payment Setup**
    *   **Description**: Configure your Stripe account and products to accept payments in all the currencies corresponding to your target markets.
    *   **Implementation**: In your Stripe Dashboard, define the different pricing tiers for REVA (Professional, Team, Scale) for each currency you plan to support (e.g., USD, AUD, EUR, BRL, SGD, SAR). These prices in Stripe must **exactly match** the prices dynamically displayed on your landing page to prevent discrepancies. You can use Stripe's API to manage these product and price objects programmatically.

*   **2.2. Currency Passing in Checkout**
    *   **Description**: Ensure the currency selected (automatically or manually) on the landing page is passed to the Stripe Checkout session.
    *   **Implementation**: When creating a Stripe Checkout Session (which is the recommended secure way to integrate Stripe for web payments), include the `currency` parameter with the detected or selected currency code. Stripe will then handle the charge in that specific currency.

*   **2.3. Currency Conversion and Settlement (Stripe's Side)**
    *   **Description**: Stripe performs the necessary currency conversions to settle funds into your chosen payout currency.
    *   **Implementation**: Within your Stripe account settings, specify your default payout currency (e.g., USD or SGD). When a customer pays in a currency different from your payout currency, Stripe will automatically convert the funds using its mid-market exchange rates, adding a small margin and conversion fee. This means you don't need to manage this conversion yourself. Monitor your Stripe reports for detailed breakdowns of FX conversions and fees.

*   **2.4. PCI Compliance and Security**
    *   **Description**: Leverage Stripe's built-in security features to maintain PCI DSS compliance.
    *   **Implementation**: Always use Stripe's secure payment interfaces, such as [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=checkout) or [Stripe Elements](https://stripe.com/docs/elements), which handle sensitive card data directly and ensure you never store it on your own servers. Set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications about payment successes, failures, refunds, and disputes.

*   **2.5. Local Payment Methods and User Experience (UX)**
    *   **Description**: Enhance conversion by offering popular local payment methods.
    *   **Implementation**: Stripe Checkout can intelligently display payment methods most relevant to the customer's location (e.g., iDEAL for the Netherlands, SEPA Direct Debit for Europe, Alipay for Chinese customers). Enable these within your Stripe account. Testing the full payment flow from various geographical locations will be crucial to ensure a seamless and intuitive experience for all users.

#### 3. Additional Considerations

*   **High Availability and Failover**: Implement fallback mechanisms for your geolocation and currency exchange rate APIs. If an API is down, default to your base currency and display a message, or use cached rates to avoid service interruption.
*   **Session Persistence**: Ensure the user's selected currency or auto-detected currency persists throughout their session as they navigate the landing page and proceed to checkout.
*   **Legal Disclaimer**: Include clear terms and conditions on your website regarding pricing, currency conversions, and any potential fees applied by banks or payment processors.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Optimize all scripts and API calls to ensure the page loads quickly and dynamically updates prices without lag, contributing to a smooth user experience.
