Excellent! To achieve $100k in pre-sales, you'll need a highly optimized landing page that combines proven psychological triggers with strategic segmentation. Here's a comprehensive framework:

## Revenue Math & Pricing Strategy

**Target: $100k requires strategic pricing tiers:**
- **Elite Founders**: $2,500 (40 members = $100k)
- **Standard Founders**: $1,500 (67 members = $100k)
- **Mixed approach**: 20 Elite ($2,500) + 50 Standard ($1,500) = $125k

## Core Psychological Triggers

### 1. **Scarcity & Exclusivity (Most Critical)**
```
"Only 50 Founding Member spots available globally"
"Elite Tier: Limited to 20 seats only"
"Applications close when spots are filled"
```

**Implementation:**
- Real-time counter: "47 spots remaining"
- Geographic scarcity: "Only 3 spots left in Singapore"
- Time-based urgency: "Early Bird pricing ends in 7 days"

```
Regular Price After Launch: $8,000/year
